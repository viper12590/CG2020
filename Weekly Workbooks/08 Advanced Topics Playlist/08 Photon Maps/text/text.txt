Previously we used ambient lighting as an approximation to global illumination. However, this is a very big approximation, that prevents us from rendering certain types of lighting effect. _Photon maps_ offer a more sophisticated approach that allow us to precompute patterns of light dispersal in order to (relatively) efficiently render more realistic indirect illumination.
