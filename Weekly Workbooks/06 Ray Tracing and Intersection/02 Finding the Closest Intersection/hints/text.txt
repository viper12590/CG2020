To help you towards implementing your `getClosestIntersection` function, below is a code equivalent of the ray/triangle intersection equation that was shown in the slides at the top of this section:  

``` cpp
vec3 e0 = triangle.vertices[1] - triangle.vertices[0];
vec3 e1 = triangle.vertices[2] - triangle.vertices[0];
vec3 SPVector = cameraPosition - triangle.vertices[0];
mat3 DEMatrix(-rayDirection, e0, e1);
vec3 possibleSolution = glm::inverse(DEMatrix) * SPVector;
```
Remember that the `possibleSolution` calculated by the above code is **not** the [x,y,z] coordinates of a point in 3 dimensional space, but rather a three-element data structure that consists of:

- `t` the distance along the ray from the camera to the intersection point
- `u` the proportion along the triangle's first edge that the intersection point occurs
- `v` the proportion along the triangle's second edge that the intersection point occurs
